    Three components, weighted:
    
    50% — Sensitivity + Specificity (F1) across all patients
    30% — Did it catch the activity-masked emergency?
           (patient exercising with high HR — is it exercise or cardiac event?)
    20% — Triage priority: did it attend to critical patients over stable ones?
    
    This is genuinely hard because:
    - One patient has high HR from exercise → should IGNORE
    - One patient has high HR from cardiac event → should ALERT
    - The vitals look identical, only activity context differentiates them
